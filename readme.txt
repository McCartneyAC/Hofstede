Introdution: 

This flash drive contains files and folders as specified by the requirements for the final project for Data Management during the Fall semester of 2017. This ReadMe file will clarify the organization of the files and folders contained herein; however, the bulk of functionality will be contained within 'main.do' contained within the main directory of the flash drive. 

The folders are nested into the following tree: 
	(1)Data Files
		(1a)UN Data Main
		(1b)UN Data Needs Cleanning (Deprecated)
		(1c)Hofstede
	(2)datavis
	(3)do_files
	(4)Documents
	(5)miscellaneous

Specification of Each Folder: 

	(1) Data files contains all the necessary data to merge into the final data set, and may include some legacy data sets that were considered but not included in the final analysis (e.g. Refugees per Country) but which I have elected to keep on a pro re nata basis. The final data set rests in this top folder due to its relative prominence

	(1a) UN Data Main contains all the main data files for this project with the exception of the raw data for hofstede's dimensions. This will include raw data, multiple levels of cleaned datasets, then the merged data up to but excluding the final data set. 

	(1b) UN Data Needs Cleaning contains raw data files that were from a legacy version of the project and should no longer be valid, but which were kept to insure backward compatibility of the code should any legacy code survive. 

	(1c) Hofstede contains raw and cleaned files related to Hofstede's dimensions. 

	(2) datavis contains all the outputs of data visualizations including charts, diagrams, etc. including tabular data such as regression outputs, correlation matrices, and the like. Significantly, datavis  also contains the .do files for each of the graphs generated, as individual .do files, because when placed together in one large .do file they worked as individual lines of code but appeared to interfere with each other when run en masse. I am not satisfied with this ad hoc solution, but have run out of time to fix it. 

	(3) do_files contains all the do files for this project, including a copy of the main.do file which runs the other three. It also contains copies of .do files from elsewhere in the project, i.e. from datavis. 

	(4) Documents contains documents related to this project, e.g. the proposal, the powerpoint presentation,  a source which inspired most of this work, and any other documents generated by the project (namely, the  final papers). It also includes Hofstede's technical manual for the VSM which generates the cultural dimensions data.

	(5) miscellaneous is as the name implies. As of now, it only contains R code for a previous version of the project which was utilized for the proposal. 

About the Final Data Set:

	The final data set contains 5,744 observations of 72 variables. However, the user will note two important details. 

		First, that for the majority of observations, the data are missing. The simple fact is that these country-level metrics were not always measured for every year or for every country. Some of these  metrics are, for example, quite new and only being reported on by as few as 20 nations. Other metrics are older but were not counted consistently, or were not counted in places where data were hard to collect, e.g. in Somalia or Afghanistan. For other nations, it seems that an assumption was made that the country was doing well and metrics were not needed with regard to the MDGS, and therefore data were never reported. The result is a large data set with many possible observations; however, those observations are only filled in when those data were collected, to the best of UN/UNESCO's ability.

		Second, two one-to-many joins were made within the data assembly process: First the inquality-adjusted economic measures and then Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions. Therefore, though it would seem to indicate because the panel data are country-by-year that these should change with time, but this is not the case--these data reflect the most updated data in the year of collection (2017) and not  any change over time: only the Development Goals data reflect the year variable.
